# Online Class Material

Due to Covid-19, the Fall 2020 ML class is being taught online.  To facilitate
online teaching, I have begun to create videos for the lectures.
The videos mostly follow the powerpoint slides, although sometimes the powerpoint
slides have more material.  Each lecture is broken down into a few sections.
Watch the video in each section and then try to do the exercise for that section
before continuing.  The exercise is typically very simple.  The solutions 
for most of the exercises are included here, but in some cases, I have left
out the solutions since they will be covered in the discussion section.

Right now, I only have a small fraction of the videos for the class, but
I am hoping to add more as the class progresses.
